I'm a web developer in beautiful Portland, Oregon with an organization called [Metal Toad](http://metaltoad.com). Since Portland is evidently huge on extracurriculars, I'm working hard to try new stuff and have adventures to compensate for how uninteresting I am. In my former life, I was big on pubs, sports, and Sci-Fi.
