I'm a web developer currently living in Philadelphia. Most of my days involve hacking together Drupal projects for nonprofits and colleges. I really enjoy tinkering with other frameworks, though, so this blog actually runs on Jekyll. There's something really satisfying about simple solutions.

Right now, when I'm not scheming about Drupaly things, I've been getting really excited about Meteor, node.js, and Phonegap. When I'm feeling less ambitious, though, my favorite things are pubs, sci-fi, and hanging out with my strange gaggle of roommates (1 fiance, 2 cats, [1 internet sensation](http://boehmrya.net)).
