We've made a good number of adjustments to their main site at <a href=\"http://www.afsc.org\" target=\"_blank\">AFSC.org</a> and done some cool micro-projects. The pic above is from <a href=\"http://www.afsc.org/boycott/\" target=\"_blank\">Boycott!</a>, a microsite devoted to a travelling poster exhibition.</p>",
