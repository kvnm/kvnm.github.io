It turns out that we landed in Portland, and I'm working for a great shop called [Metal Toad](http://metaltoad.com).

Oregon is absolutely fantastic. I can see mountains from our balcony, we live 2 minutes from a brewery and a non-profit pub, and everybody I meet is super-enthusiastic about being here. Metal Toad is also fantastic. The people are great, really welcoming, and very supportive. Work is a ton of fun, which is a weird thing to think about. I basically get to show up, hang out with cool people, really dive into my work, respond to a few foosball challenges, and then kick back a few drafts *in the office*. At lunchtime, there are some great restaurants near the office, but I usually prefer to head to one of the **three** enormous food truck pods. I'm going to have to find some kind of athletic hobby soon... the Hawaiian food carts are almost impossible for me to pass up.
