Even when I've been down on Philadelphia, I've always thought that springtime here is great. After a cold, miserable, not-so-productive winter, Spring is finally starting to come around and make everything alright. So far, we've hit Drupal Camp NYC, Lancaster a few times, a meetup, the Cherry Blossom festival, and plenty of happy hours. I've grabbed a book on node.js and a big ol' e-book on meteor.js, which should keep me busy for a while. I've also bagged a cheapo Digital Ocean account, so I may eventually get around to doing something more interesting with kevinmcconnaughay.com.

Even work is more fun nowadays. I've been dealing with lots of tough stuff lately, but it's been challenging in a really good way, and it makes me feel like I'm actively learning at work, which is exactly what I want. The pledge wall for the Scattergood Foundation has some pretty neat stuff going on and should launch in the next week or two.

Aug and I are still talking a lot about moving out West. She's been poking around, which is good, and just started mentioning Oregon this morning, so we'll see where that goes.
