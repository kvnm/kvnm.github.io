First real drupal.org activity today. It came in a flurry once it dawned on me how easy it was. Funny how that works. Everything is intimidating until its not.

Made myself a sandbox for splash_block, submitted an issue and a patch for authorizenetwebform, and then got so excited that I went ahead and did some refactoring/refining and pushed up another splash_block commit. Pretty small stuff in the grand scheme of things, but maybe the most fun I've had with the kind of thing all winter.
