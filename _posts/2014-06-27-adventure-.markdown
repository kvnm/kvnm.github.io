We've decided this week that we're definitely going West. I'll be sad to leave Philadelphia after really coming to enjoy it, but we've been talking about this for so long that it's a relief to finally decide something. Also, we're lighting a fire under our butts and setting a deadline, so the only question now is where exactly we want to land.

Meanwhile, I've had some exciting stuff happen on the code front. After a lot of iterations and improvements, and a month-long review process, [my Drupal module](http://drupal.org/project/splash_block) is finally a thing. Definitely feels good to have that out of the way, and I'm pretty proud of how it turned out.

For NMS, I've got some fun projects on the horizon. An interactive office seat map, which I'll use leaflet.js for, a big front-end job for a really cool project on historical records, and a mobile project. Since I've decided to use Ionic for the mobile project, I've been hitting Angular.js up lately, and used my homepage as an excuse to screw around. I think it turned out pretty fun.

Adventuring this weekend, even, out to Washington, D.C. Ma's going to be there, which is always a fun time.
