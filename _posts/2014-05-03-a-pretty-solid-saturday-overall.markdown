I've been going through my Meteor book-- just got through the chapter on routing. This thing is definitely a fun thing. Live data and page reloads make me feel like I'm one of those 1990s movie hackers that slam their clammy paws into a keyboard while waves of 0s and 1s, with some scattered skulls-and-cross-bones, fly by.

Anyway, that reminded me that I sort of decided to blog here, so that I don't forget that Jekyll is cool. Also, so that I can have some sort of log of what I've been up to. Got a rake task set up so this is trivially easy now.

Right now I'm typing this out across the table from [boehmrya](http://boehmry.net), noted internet personality, who's stuffing his stupid ugly face with Trader Joe's pizza. Auguste just came downstairs with our tickets to Eddie Izzard.
